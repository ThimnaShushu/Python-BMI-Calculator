    # BMI Calculator 🧮🏃‍♀️

This is a simple Python project that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies them based on standard BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

### 🌟 Motivation

This project is inspired by my personal weight loss journey. Along the way, I realized how important it is to track progress in a healthy and data-driven way. I created this BMI calculator to help me (and others) stay informed and motivated by keeping track of changes in body weight and health status.
